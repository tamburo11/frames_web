      </p>
<br>
      <div>
        FRAMES is a <b>free graphical spectral processor</b> for 
        <a href="https://www.ableton.com/" target="_blank">Ableton Live</a>, developed with Max for Live 
        (<a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/" target="_blank">M4L</a>) by <a href="http://www.albertobarberis.it/" target="_blank">Alberto Barberis</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.bienoise.com/" target="_blank">Alberto Ricca</a>.
        
        FRAMES allows you to manipulate a sound source of an Ableton Live track using 
        a sound synthesis technique called analysis-resynthesis with graphical interaction. 
        The implementation of this technique is based on the amazing work by Jean-Francois Charles. For more info check 
        <a href="https://cycling74.com/tools/charles-spectral-tutorials" target="_blank">this</a>.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        FRAMES allows you to create a 2D image of the spectrogram of a sound source (with FFT analysis), 
        to manipulate it with some graphical transformations and to resynthesize it in loop and in real-time. 
        
        <br><br>The loop region is in sync with the tempo and the time signature of Ableton Live. 
        The FFT analysis can be performed with a size of 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 samples 
        (adapting it to the type of sound material). 
        <br><br>
        The possible sound-image transformations are: <br><br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>a spectral gate effect (with two different modes 
                that allows you to maintain only the spectrum components with a magnitude higher or lower than a threshold );</li>
            <br><li>a spectral time stretch (changing the playback speed);</li>
            <br><li>a spectral "time-blur" (Future) or "time-drier" (Past) (a sort of spectral reverb amount);</li>
            <br><li>the application of a transformation matrix, that allows you to perform scaling, rotation, skewing and perspective operation on the spectrogram;</li>
        </ul> 

        <br> 
        FRAMES offers a deep user interface to control the graphical 
        transformations parameters, with immediate sonical results. 
        Besides you can set the amount of processing with a Dry/Wet control, 
        and also save two different presets and interpolate between them. 
        <br> <br>
        The result is a simple spectral processing tool that allows you to synthesize unexpected sounds, 
        complex spectral textures and irregular rhythmic loops, allowing an innovative exploration 
        of the spectral possibilities of a sample.

        <b class="titoletti"> HOW TO INSTALL F<span class="erre">R</span>AMES </b> 
     </p><br>

     <ol>
        <li>
            Download the FRAMES folder from <a href="https://github.com/tamburo11/frames" target="_blank">THIS REPOSITORY</a>. 
          </li><br>
          <li> Unzip the folder and place it in your Ableton User Library folder: Ableton/User Library/Presets/Audio Effects/Max Audio Effects;</li>
          <br><li>Open Ableton Live; you will find the device here: Max for Live > Max Audio Effect > FRAMES_v.1.2.2.amxd; place it in an audio track;</li>

      <div>
          <ol>

              <br><li>Send an audio to the device (for example playing a clip in the track that contains the device);</li>
              <br><li>Choose the FFT frame size ① (adapting it to the type of sound material: 512 samples for percussive sounds, 4096 for texture sounds);</li>
              <br><li>Choose the length of the sample that you want to record and process ②;</li>
              <br><li>Clik the Record button ③ (if you ckick on the Play button ④ you will hear the real-time resynthesis);</li>
              <br><li>Start your graphical manipulation:
                  <ul>
                      <li>using the two types of gate effect ⑤ (or bypass it clicking on pass);</li>
                      <li>changing the playback speed ⑥;</li>
                      <li>changing the amount of the "spectral reverb" ⑦;</li>
                      <li>changing the transformation matrix parameters being inspired by the symbols ⑧  (when everything goes crazy use the Reset button);</li>
                  </ul></li>
                <br><li>When you find a cool configuration save it in a preset (1 or 2) and try to interpolate between presets;</li>
                <br><li>Set your desired output gain and Dry/Wet amount;</li>
                <br><li>Enjoy!</li>
